# Zoom Tool

ImageJ macro tool to allow flexible zoom in and out.

Left mouse click zooms in; right mouse click zooms out.
Continues zoom by keeping mouse button down.

Double click on icon to set increments.

Known problems:

1. Before you can zoom out for the first time (right mouse click)  you first have to zoom in once, if you use the right mouse click popup menu, as otherwise this menu is not disabled.
2. At higher zooms the increase in zoom is not always as expected.

## Download code

Select the file "ZoomTool.ijm" and select "Raw" from the right side menu. Select all the code and copy and paste this into the text editor from ImageJ/Fiji (File > New > Text Window). Alternatively, you can download all files via the green "Code" button as a ZIP file and extract the macro file. Save this file in your macros/tools sub-folder within the ImageJ or Fiji folder with the name ZoomTool.ijm.

## Run macro

Install the macro via Plugins > Macros > Install ... and an icon with a "Z" will be added to the icon tool bar, till you restart ImageJ/Fiji.
